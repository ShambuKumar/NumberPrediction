# Mind Reading Artificial Intelligence

A simple mathematical coding project to "read your mind" in  few questions.
You need to enter a number range (Your number is within zero and your "number range)
Then you have to answer a few simple questions (like 7 if your "number range" is 100) and tells you which number you thought of!

Does not actually use any Neural Networks or Machine Learning. It just narrows down the possible options in a very efficient way. Please excuse the website, it is nor reactive at all!
